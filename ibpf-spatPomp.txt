Working out what to do to incorporate ibpf into spatPomp

1. should allow for shared parameters & unit-specific parameters

2. the package should include at least 1 example which ibpf can be checked 
on. (a) measles; (b) linear gaussian example for testing.

3. unit tests, giving 100% line coverage via "make covr"
 
4. adding ibpf to the ms
(a) pseudocode, sec 4.3.
(b) for example, we can cite the numerical work for the stat sinica paper.

5. service functions for moving between expanded, contracted and basic 
parameter formats: see param_formats.R. These also need to be described in 
the ms.

plan: (4,5) are added to the supplement, which is posted on arxiv as an 
updated version of the previous arxiv paper.
