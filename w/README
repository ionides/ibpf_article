w1.r : evaluates likelihood for ../sim/sim.rds at the true parameter values
       for the simulation.

w2.r : evaluates likelihood for data, using he10 mle values
       (uncoupled, with immigration) which can be compared against he10
       likelihoods.

w3.r : checking that conditional likelihoods for the uncoupled
       he10 model match the he10 likelihoods for each unit.
