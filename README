Source code for: An iterated block particle filter for inference on coupled dynamic systems with shared and unit-specific parameters

E. L. Ionides, J. Wheeler and N. Ning

This repository is a public version of the source code for the article. The code was run using spatPomp 0.29.0.0 (see z3/z1a_3/sessionInfo.txt). Later versions of spatPomp incorporate the functions ibpf() and he10() included below.

ms.Rnw The document source code.

ibpf.R    A spatPomp implementation. requires a unit-specific representation of shared parameters.

measles2.R  A version of the UK measles model with requested parameters given a unit-specific representation.

he10.R A variation of measles2.R which matches He et al (2010) "Plug-and-play inference for disease dynamics: Measles in large and small towns as a case study" Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

data The data files from he10.

param_formats.R  book-keeping functions for moving between different parameter representations.

sim, sim.r  a simulation from he10.R used for testing.

v4. ibpf on measles simulated data.

v. An older version of v4.

w testing likelihood evaluation, and getting a good evaluation at the truth for a simulated model.

z3. ibpf on measles data as used for he10.
