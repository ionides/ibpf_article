  {\Large\bf An iterated block particle filter for inference on coupled dynamic systems with shared and unit-specific parameters}

%% ABSTRACT: We consider inference for a collection of partially observed, stochastic, interacting, nonlinear dynamic processes. Each process is called a unit, and our primary motivation arises in biological metapopulation systems where a unit is a spatially distinct sub-population. Block particle filters are an effective tool for simulation-based likelihood evaluation for these systems, which are strongly dependent through time on a single unit and relatively weakly coupled between units. Iterated filtering algorithms can facilitate likelihood maximization for simulation-based filters. We introduce a new iterated block particle filter algorithm applicable to parameters that are either unit-specific or shared between units. We demonstrate this algorithm to carry out inference on a coupled epidemiological model for spatiotemporal measles case report data in twenty towns.

\begin{frame}{Questions to be addressed}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item When can we carry out full-information likelihood-based inference on a general class of spatiotemporal partially observed Markov process models?
  \item When should we want to?
  \item Is there an intersection between scientific problems of interest and the capabilities of the \texttt{spatPomp} R package?
  \end{enumerate}

  \vspace{10mm}

  We introduce the {\bf iterated block particle filter} because it is currently the most powerful algorithm available in \texttt{spatPomp}.

  \bi
\item Looking at one unit (town) is \myemph{time series analysis}.

  \item Joint modeling of a few units (say, 2 or 3) is \myemph{multivariate time series analysis}.

\item Analysis of many time series, without consideration of dynamic interactions, is \myemph{panel data analysis}.

\item Allowing for coupling between units, we get \myemph{spatiotemporal analysis}, which in our context is \myemph{metapopulation analysis}.

  \ei
  
Question: When should we avoid inference for spatiotemporal models? When do we need to consider coupling? How?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Desiderata}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item We want to be able to fit arbitrary dynamic models. The limitations should be our scientific creativity and the information in the data.

    \item In practice, that means using \myemph{plug-and-play} methods which need a simulator from the model but not nice closed-form expressions for densities.

    \item We want statistically efficient inference, to extract all the information in the data.

    \item In practice, that means using likelihood-based methods.

      \item  In the time series case, iterated particle filtering (IF2) implemented in the R package \texttt{pomp} enables Masters-level statisticians to do this (\url{https://ionides.github.io/531w22/}). The science may be hard, but the statistics is becoming routine.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Panel data}

\bi
\item To investigate epidemiological dynamics in multiple cities, one can consider each city independently, perhaps modeling a background immigration rate of infections for each city.

\item \myemph{Decoupling} leads to panel data analysis, by assumption. Iterated filtering methods extend to panel data (Breto et al, {\it Journal of the American Statistical Association}, 2019).

\item We must decide which parameters should be modeled as \myemph{shared} vs \myemph{unit-specific}.

\item The consequences of decoupling are becoming easier to study with the development of statistical inference methods for coupled systems, i.e., metapopulation dynamics.

  \ei

  \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The curse of dimensionality}

  \bi
  \item
    Particle filter (PF) methods are effective for inference on low-dimensional nonlinear partially observed stochastic dynamic systems. They scale exponentially badly.

\item Extending the successes of particle filter methods from time series data to metapopulation data is becoming possible.

\item Algorithms under consideration:\\
  {\bf
  Bagged filters (BF, IBF)\\
  Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF, IEnKF)\\
  Guided intermediate resampling filter (GIRF, IGIRF)\\
  Block particle filter (BPF, IBPF)\\
  }
  
\item Filters estimate latent states and evaluate the likelihood.
\item Each filter has an iterated version which estimates parameters by repeated filtering using stochastic parameter perturbations.

\item These algorithms are all implemented in an R package, \texttt{spatPomp}.

\item BPF worked quickly, easily and reliably on our measles model filtering experiments.

\item This motivated us to develop an IBPF for parameter estimation.
   
\item BPF has theoretical support in some situations (Rebeschini \& Van Handel, {\it Annals of Applied Probability}, 2015).

\item BPF was independently proposed as the ``factored particle filter'' by Ng et al (2002, {\it Proc. 18th Conference on Uncertainty and Artificial Intelligence}) but not widely popularized.

\begin{frame}{Scalability needed for practical inference}

Large numbers of parameters
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  Initial conditions will typically have to be estimated for each unit.
  \item Various dynamic parameters and measurement parameters (e.g., reporting rate) may also need to be unit-specific to obtain a statistical fit to the data.
\item Working with hundreds of estimated parameters raises additional challenges on top of the high-dimensional coupled dynamics.
  \end{itemize}

\vspace{5mm}
  
A moderate numbers of spatial units is enough to open new possibilities.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item As soon as dimension exceeds capabilities of a particle filter (say, $U=5$) we are in situations where likelihood-based inference for general models has been inaccessible.

  \item 10-100 coupled units is our target problem size.

  \item Larger problems will need numerical approximations (e.g., EnKF). Exact Monte Carlo methods help study the effect of these approximations.
