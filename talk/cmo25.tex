  {\Large\bf Inference on spatiotemporal infectious disease dynamics}

%ABSTRACT: Epidemiological models must be consistent with observed data in order to generate reliable knowledge and evidence-based policy. Metapopulation systems, which consist of a network of connected sub-populations, pose technical challenges in statistical inference owing to nonlinear, stochastic interactions. Numerical difficulties encountered in conducting inference can obstruct the core scientific questions concerning the link between the mathematical models and the data. Recently, an algorithm has been proposed that enables computationally tractable likelihood-based inference for high-dimensional partially observed stochastic dynamic models of metapopulation systems. We use this algorithm to build a statistically principled data analysis workflow for metapopulation systems. Via a case study of COVID-19, we show how this workflow addresses the limitations of previous approaches. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a situation where mathematical models and their policy implications were widely visible, and we revisit an influential metapopulation model used to inform basic epidemiological understanding early in the pandemic. Our methods support self-critical data analysis, enabling us to identify and address model weaknesses, leading to a new model with substantially improved statistical fit and parameter identifiability. Our results suggest that the lockdown initiated on 23 January 2020 in China was more effective than previously thought.

\begin{frame}{Question to be addressed}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item When can we carry out full-information likelihood-based inference on nonlinear non-Gaussian spatiotemporal partially observed Markov process (SpatPOMP) models? In particular, models for networks of interacting biological population dynamics.

        \vspace{2mm}

\item We introduce the {\bf iterated block particle filter}, currently the most effective algorithm in the \texttt{spatPomp} R package.

\vspace{2mm}

\item Bonus question: How do we know if our model is statistically adequate, or needs more work? Hint: we need {\bf performance benchmarks}, i.e., comparison with non-mechanistic machine learning methods. If there is performance shortfall, we need diagnostics to figure out where and how.

\item Tracked down by assessing conditional log-likelihood for each unit and each time.

\item Some weak identifiability remained. extra assumptions can lead to plausible parameter estimates without much loss of model fit.

  \item The Gaussian-inspired update rule is similar to the extended Kalman filter (EKF), which has largely been superseded by particle filter methods for low-dimensional nonlinear biological dynamics.

    \vspace{2mm}
    
\item Simple systems can defeat EnKF: the linear Gaussian update is helpless when data inform the conditional variance rather than the conditional mean.

  \vspace{2mm}
  
    \item Big systems need computationally tractable analysis. EnKF may sometimes be the best solution available, but be aware of its limitations.

  \item Comparing the block log-likelihood against the benchmark provides insight into problematic units.

    \item Comparing the conditional log-likelihood for each observation against the benchmark helps to identify outliers. 

    \item Two recent case studies (Wheeler et al, 2023; Li et al, 2023) demonstrate data analysis using IBPF. Code and data are provided via R packages extending \code{spatPomp}.
