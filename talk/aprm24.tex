  {\Large\bf An iterated block particle filter for inference on coupled dynamic systems}

% ABSTRACT
% We consider inference for a collection of partially observed, stochastic, interacting, nonlinear dynamic processes. Each process is called a unit, and our primary motivation arises in biological metapopulation systems where a unit is a spatially distinct sub-population. Block particle filters are an effective tool for simulation-based likelihood evaluation for these systems, which are strongly dependent through time on a single unit and relatively weakly coupled between units. Iterated filtering algorithms can facilitate likelihood maximization for simulation-based filters. We introduce a new iterated block particle filter algorithm applicable to parameters that are either unit-specific or shared between units. We demonstrate this algorithm to carry out inference on a coupled epidemiological model for spatiotemporal COVID-19 case report data in 373 cities.

\begin{frame}{Question to be addressed}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item When can we carry out full-information likelihood-based inference on nonlinear non-Gaussian spatiotemporal partially observed Markov process (SpatPOMP) models? In particular, models for networks of interacting biological population dynamics.

        \vspace{2mm}

\item We introduce the {\bf iterated block particle filter}, currently the most powerful algorithm available in the \texttt{spatPomp} R package.

%  \vspace{2mm}

%  \item Bonus question: How do we know if our model is statistically adequate, or needs more work?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Consideration of arbitrary dynamic models. The limitations should be our scientific creativity and the information in the data.

      \vspace{2mm}
      
     Hence, \myemph{plug-and-play} methods which need a simulator from the model but not nice closed-form expressions for densities.

     \vspace{2mm}
     
    \item Statistically efficient inference, to extract all the information in the data.

      \vspace{2mm}
      
    Hence, \myemph{likelihood-based} methods.

\begin{frame}{The curse of dimensionality}

  \bi
  \item
    Particle filter (PF) methods fail for high-dimensional systems. They scale exponentially badly.

    \vspace{2mm}
    
  \item Algorithms with improved scalability include:\\

    \vspace{1mm}
    
  {\bf
  Bagged filters (BF, IBF)\\
  Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF, IEnKF)\\
  Guided intermediate resampling filter (GIRF, IGIRF)\\
  Block particle filter (BPF, IBPF)\\
  }

      \vspace{2mm}

\item Filters estimate latent states and evaluate the likelihood.

    \vspace{2mm}

  \item Iterated filters estimate parameters using stochastic parameter perturbations.

        \vspace{2mm}

\item These algorithms are all implemented in the \texttt{spatPomp} R package.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item EnKF is more dependent on approximate Gaussianity than is sometimes supposed.

    \vspace{2mm}
    
  \item The Gaussian-inspired update rule is similar to the extended Kalman filter (EKF), which has largely been superseded by particle filter methods for low-dimensional nonlinear biological dynamics.

    \vspace{2mm}
    
\item Simple systems can defeat EnKF: the linear Gaussian update is helpless when data inform the conditional variance rather than the conditional mean.

  \vspace{2mm}
  
    \item Big systems need computationally tractable analysis. EnKF may sometimes be the best solution available, but be aware of its limitations.
